    K.B.S.K. completes around 
                        34 years. These 34 years have been the years of spectacular 
                        achievements unprecedented development and progress. Though 
                        it was not easy to scale these heights, especially in 
                        the scenario we were offered by our predecessor. Yet we 
                        made it possible because of our well-directed and well 
                        - intentioned strategies vision for the development of 
                        strong implementation 20 point programme. We have cherished 
                        also, to make it a Krishi Bikash Shilpa Kendra to none 
                        in all respects.
    </p>
    <p>
    Our prime concern 
                        during all these years had been to provide responsive, 
                        corruption free and transparent administration to the 
                        people. K.B.S.K. is bound to scale new heights in every 
                        sphere of development with team work. Every bit of grain 
                        the hardworking people K.B.S.K. produce<br>
                        by toiling hard, day in day out increase the wounds of 
                        Kautlya, &ldquo;It is the people who constitute a kingdom; 
                        like a Barron cow, a&nbsp;kingdom without people yield&nbsp;nothing 
                        &ldquo;And it is
    </p>
    <p>they who have give us the opportunity it became a humble servant. One can�t help but be humbled when one enters a shrine. And for us the service of the people is just like entering a shrine.
			      The K.B.S.K. is hardly working and implementation work at 20 point programme in the state of west of west Bengal during this period has witnessed implementation of several farsighted plans such as formulation of new power police to harness immense power potential available in the state of west Bengal new industrial and tourism policies to attract more private investment in these vital sectors, coupled with unparalleled initiatives which has resulted in giving new direction for socio �economic up liftment of the people of the state.</p>
    <p>Today , we the people of Krishi Bikash Shilpa Kendra are proud to Say that we stands way ahead of the state of the India Union and Certainly ahead of all the hilly States of the country. The State of west Bengal today is quoted as a successful model of only area development but also for having realized a sort of revolution in the levels.</p>
    <p>In the development Report of Planning Commission and programme implementation the State scores high on indeces of human resource develomentation . It�s per capital outlay for sectors is the highest among all the States in the country. The relatively high status of women has been promotive of household economy, education and selfhelp groups. Using data for several indicators classified into various categories of prosperity and budget, law and order health, education consumer market agriculture, infrastructure and investment and employing the technique of principal component analysis, India Today in its survey described our K.B.S.K. as a tril-blazing success story in human development and social infrastructure scripted by a remarkable synergy between government initiative and community participation.</p>
    <p>But till date Krishi Bikash Shipa Kendra is not getting nationalization.�former Prime Minister Srimati Indira Gandhi (She was also the Defence Minister at that time) convincing her the detailed course of Business, purpose and future planning etc. and then she (Smt. Indira Gandhi) declared the programmes of KRISHI BIKASH SHILPA KENDRA as the new 20 points programme on the January 14, 1982 from the historical wall of Lal Killah, New Delhi and she directed by her section officer etc. to help to the chief secretary, Govt. of West Bengal to arrange all sorts of help to accelerate the programme of work of our organization . And next year i.e.1983 the New 20 pro grammes has been Nationalized and she directed to our organization to implements the new 20 point programmes in West Bengal (Vide order No. F-2-38(4)83 PMPI dated: 16.04.1983 and that is to say KRISHI BIKASH SHILPA KENDRA now implementing the National programme. </p>
