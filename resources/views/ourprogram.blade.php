            <h5>DAIRY DEVELOPMENT :</h5>
            <p>Krishi Bikash Shipa Kendra is working in this project since 1991-92. The Indian Dairy Industry acquired substantial growth during the 8th Plan,
                 achieving an annual output of over 69 million tones milk. India&rsquo;s milk output during ther year 2000-2001 was estimated to be 81 million tones and is expected t reach the level of 85 million tones during 2001-2002. 
                 This has not only placed the industry first in the world, but also represents sustained growth in the availability of milk and milk products for the burgeoning population of the country. Most important, dairying has become an important secondary source of income for millions of rural families and for millions more, has assumed the most important role in providing employment and income. 
                 The per capita availability of the milk has also increased to a level of about 221 g. per day, but this is still very low as compared to developed nation or the world average of 285 g per day. Government of India is making efforts to increase the productivity of milch animal and this increase the per capita availability of milk.
            </p>
            <p>The efforts of the K.B.S.K. Department in the dairy sector are concentrated on promotion of dairy activities in non-operation flood areas with emphasis on building up cooperative infrastructure, revitalization of sick dairy cooperative federation and creation of 
                  infrastructure in the States for testing the quality of milk and milk products. For pursuing these objectives, the Department has implemented 4 Schrmes in the dairy sector during 2001-2002.
            </p>
            <p>Krishi Bikash Shilpa Kendra is the one and only organisation. Operation Flood on integrated dairy development programme, completed its third phase<br>
    		    On April 30, 1996. The main thrust of programme was to consolidate the gains achieved, and to strengthen the dairy cooperative structure for sustainable development of the dairy industry in India.

The main challenges facing fisheries development in the country includes accurate data on assessment of fishery resources and their potential in terms of fish production, development of sustainable technologies for fin and their potential in terms of fish culture, 
                yield optimization, harvest and post-harvest operation, landing and berthing facilities for fishing vessels and welfare of fishermen.
