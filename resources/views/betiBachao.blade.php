    <p>The trend of decline in the Child Sex Ratio 
            (CSR), defined as number of girls per 1000 of boys between 
            0-6 years of age, has been unabated since 1961. The decline 
            from 945 in 1991 to 927 in 2001 and further to 918 in 2011 
            is alarming. The decline in the CSR is a major indicator of 
            women disempowerment. CSR reflects both, pre-birth discrimination 
            manifested through gender biased sex selection, and post birth 
            discrimination against girls. Social construct discriminating 
            against girls on the one hand, easy availability, affordability 
            and subsequent misuse of diagnostic tools on the other hand, 
            have been critical in increasing Sex Selective Elimination 
            of girls leading to low Child Sex Ratio. <br>
            Since coordinated and convergent efforts are needed to ensure 
            survival, protection and empowerment of the girl child, Government 
            has announced Beti Bachao Beti Padhao initiative. This is 
            being implemented through a national campaign and focussed 
            multi sectoral action in 100 selected districts low in CSR, 
            covering all States and UTs. This is a joint initiative of 
            Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Health 
            and Family Welfare and Ministry of Human Resource Development.
        </p>
        <h3><b>THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS INITIATIVE ARE :</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Prevention of gender biased sex selective elimination</li>
            <li>Ensuring survival & protection of the girl child</li>
            <li>Ensuring education and participation of the girl child</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>About Scheme :</b></h3>
        <p>1. The Census (2011) data showed a significant declining trend in the Child Sex Ratio (CSR),
            calculated as number of girls for every 1000 boys between age group of 0-6 years, with an all
            time low of 918 in 2011 from 976 in 1961. The decline in CSR has been unabated since 1961. This
            is an alarming indicator for women disempowerment. It reflects both pre birth discrimination
            manifested through gender biased sex selection, and post birth discrimination against girls. The
            decline is widespread across the country and has expanded to rural as well as tribal areas.
        </p>
        <p>2. Alarmed by the sharp decline, the Government of India has introduced Beti Bachao, Beti
            Padhao (BBBP) programme to address the issue of decline in CSR in 100 gender critical
            districts. Coordinated & convergent efforts are needed to ensure survival, protection and
            education of the girl child.
        </p>
